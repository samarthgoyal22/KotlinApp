Problem Statement
There was no weather app with a simplistic UI (without the distracting and heavy data consuming animations) to predict the weather forecast for the next 7 days with the functionality of choosing a region on basis of Pincode.

Solution:
With weather app, you can predict 7 days weather. You can change the location in the settings tab, by entering your location Pincode in the textfield.

Functionality & Concepts used
The API used is Openweather API and the layout is constrained. The API requests the required data from the server as soon as the app is opened. The app has a simple UI and fetches the weather details with the help of an API and converts the required information into the data to calculate and display the predicted temperature range for the next 7 as well as the high and low temperature of the current day. Majorly Kotlin was used with a jist of dbhelper.

App link and Future Scope:
https://github.com/samarthgoyal22/KotlinApp.git
We are planning to add features like wind speed, precipitation chances, humidity percentage, wind direction, UV rate
Weâ€™ll try to improve UI and make it more attractive.
Add maps and GPS location, weather will be shown based on GPS coordinates.
